# Notebook-Churn-Prediction

Notebook where I identify whether a costumer will churn or not (leave their energy company provider) based on data and historic data.

It uses different Supervised models: Logistic Regression, KNN, Decission Tree Classifier & Random Forest

It is detailed how I did all the data cleaning, preprocess, models and evaluation step by step. Used https://towardsdatascience.com/predict-customer-churn-in-python-e8cd6d3aaa7 as overall guide.
